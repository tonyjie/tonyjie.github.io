I am currently a third year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University @ [Computer System Lab](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/), advised by Prof. [Zhiru Zhang](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/index.html). 

My research interests fall on building novel computer systems and supporting heterogeneous computing on novel applications, including computational genomics and machine learning. My recent focus is to leverage the best performance on GPUs. 

I received my B.E. from Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University in 2020. I conducted my undergraduate research in [NICS-EFC Lab](http://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn), advised by Prof. [Yu Wang](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/YuWang). During the summer 2019, I was an research intern at UCLA [VAST Lab](https://vast.cs.ucla.edu/), advised by Prof. [Jason Cong](https://vast.cs.ucla.edu/people/faculty/jason-cong).
